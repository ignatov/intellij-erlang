Detects the use of triple quotes for string literals in Erlang code.
<p>
    This inspection highlights the usage of triple quotes (""") for string literals, which were introduced in Erlang 27.
    Triple-quoted strings allow for multi-line string literals without the need for line continuation characters.
</p>
<p>
    Example of a triple-quoted string:
</p>
<pre><code>
TripleQuotedString = """
    This is a multi-line
    string literal using
    triple quotes.
    """
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
    Triple-quoted strings are only supported in Erlang 27 and later versions. Using them in earlier versions will result in a syntax error.
    This inspection helps ensure compatibility with older Erlang versions and highlights potential issues when working with codebases that need to support multiple Erlang versions.
