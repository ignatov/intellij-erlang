# Erlang plugin
Erlang Plugin turns [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) to a convenient [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) IDE.

# Pre-release builds
You can manually set up the plugin latest version from the [intellij-erlang-builds](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4sbgxzjto5fa21b/1cpM3Nb-yF) folder.

Note for **Mac OS X** users: you need to download the entire zip file, not a several jars (see [Apple discussion forum](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1483114)).
